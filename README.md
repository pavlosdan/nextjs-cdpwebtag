# CDPWebtag

CDPWebtag is a React component designed to integrate Acquia CDP Webtag into your Next.js applications seamlessly. It dynamically fetches and configures the necessary `$A1Config` variable required for CDP Webtag operations.

## Installation

You can install the package via npm:

```bash
npm install @acquia/cdpwebtag
```
## Environment Setup
Before using the CDPWebtag component, you need to configure your environment variables. Create a .env.local file in the root of your Next.js project and populate it with the following variables:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_A1_DOMAIN=.acquia.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_A1_TENANT_ID=999
NEXT_PUBLIC_A1_HOST=//url.endpoint.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_USERNAME=your_username
NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_PASSWORD=your_password
```
## Explanation of Environment Variables
- **NEXT_PUBLIC_A1_DOMAIN**: The main domain for your Acquia CDP instance (e.g., .acquia.com).
- **NEXT_PUBLIC_A1_TENANT_ID**: Your static tenant ID (e.g., 999).
- **NEXT_PUBLIC_A1_HOST**: The service endpoint URL according to your hosted environment and cloud region (e.g., //url.endpoint.com).
- **NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_USERNAME**: Your username for authenticating with the Acquia CDP service.
- **NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_PASSWORD**: Your password for authenticating with the Acquia CDP service.

## Usage
To use the CDPWebtag component in your Next.js application, you need to integrate it within the app directory if you are using the App Router. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

### Step 1: Create the CDPWebtag Component
First, ensure you have the CDPWebtag component in your application:

```tsx
// app/layout.tsx
import { ReactNode } from 'react';
import { CDPWebtag } from '@acquia/cdpwebtag';
import './globals.css';

export const metadata = {
  title: 'My Next.js App',
  description: 'A description of my app',
};

export default function RootLayout({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        <CDPWebtag />
        {children}
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```
### Step 2: Ensure Your Environment Variables are Set
Make sure your .env.local file is properly configured with the necessary environment variables as described above.
